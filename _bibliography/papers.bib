   abstract = {Thermal collapse of an isolated skyrmion on a two-dimensional spin lattice has been investigated. The method is based upon solution of the system of stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equations for up to 10 4 spins. The recently developed pulse-noise algorithm has been used for the stochastic component of the equations. The collapse rate follows the Arrhenius law. Analytical formulas derived within a continuous spin-field model support numerically-obtained values of the energy barrier. The pre-exponential factor is independent of the phenomenological damping constant that implies that the skyrmion is overcoming the energy barrier due to the energy exchange with the rest of the spin system. Our findings agree with experiments, as well as with recent numerical results obtained by other methods.},

   abstract = {Quantum collapse of a small skyrmion in a thin magnetic film with Dzyalishinskii-Moriya (DMI) interaction has been studied. The energy of the skyrmion and the stability threshold determined by the DMI, the external magnetic field, and the underlying atomic lattice are investigated analytically and numerically. The Lagrangian describing the coupled dynamics of the skyrmion size and the chirality angle is derived. Equations of motion possess an instanton solution that corresponds to the skyrmion underbarrier contraction via quantum tunneling with subsequent collapse and decay of the topological charge. The tunneling rate is computed and the conditions needed to observe quantum collapse of a skyrmion in a magnetic film are discussed.},

   abstract = {Quantum states of a skyrmion in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic lattice are obtained by quantizing the scaling parameter of Belavin-Polyakov model. Skyrmion classical collapse due to violation of the translational invariance of the continuous spin-field model by the lattice is replaced in quantum mechanics by transitions between discrete energy levels of the skyrmion. Rates of transitions due to emission of magnons are computed. Ways of detecting quantization of skyrmion states are discussed.},

   abstract = {We study the impact of an exchange-reducing defect on a skyrmion in a thin film of finite thickness. Attraction of the skyrmion to a defect is demonstrated in a lattice model by computing the micromagnetic energy accounting for the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and dipole-dipole coupling. The spiraling dynamics of the skyrmion toward the defect is illustrated by solving numerically the full Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations on a lattice and, independently, by solving the Thiele equation, with the two methods in agreement with each other. Depinning of the skyrmion by the current is investigated. We find that the skyrmion deforms when it is close to the defect. Deformation is small in the parameter space far from the phase boundary that determines stability of skyrmions. It increases dramatically near the phase boundary, leading to the transformation of the skyrmion by the defect into a snake-like magnetic domain.},

   abstract = {The stability of graphene cantilever under Casimir attraction to an underlying conductor is investigated. The dependence of the instability threshold on temperature and flexural rigidity is obtained. Analytical work is supplemented by numerical computation of the critical temperature above which the graphene cantilever irreversibly bends down and attaches to the conductor. The geometry of the attachment and exfoliation of the graphene sheet is discussed. It is argued that graphene cantilever can be an excellent tool for precision measurements of the Casimir force.},
