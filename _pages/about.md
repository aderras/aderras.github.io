I am a physicist who uses satellite data to develop analytical models that shed light on the complicated processes behind clouds. My research interests include cumulus parameterization and nonlinear dynamics.

In my postdoctoral research I use remote sensing to inform cumulus convection models. My group and I aim to reduce uncertainties in global climate models by improving estimates of vertical mass flux and vertical velocity.

During my graduate work I studied two-dimensional magnetic vortices called skyrmions. I solved analytical and numerical models to better understand how these quasiparticles, which are topologically protected in theory, collapse in real materials.
